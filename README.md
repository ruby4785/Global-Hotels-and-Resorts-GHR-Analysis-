# Global Hotels and Resorts GHR Analyis

This project was developed as part of Business Analytics Competition held by Saunders College Of Business at Rochester Institute Of Technology

## Scenario

Global Hotels and Resorts (GHR) is a top European hotel brand that is struggling to make
sense of its customer demands in two of its recently-acquired properties. One is a city hotel
while the other is a resort. A proper understanding of the customer demands means higher
revenue and better planning for in-house services which translates into lower operating costs.
To this end, GHR has hired your team to help them address this problem. Specifically, its
Revenue Management department wants your team to perform the following tasks:
1. Producing various visualizations to help GHR better understand the guests, booking
behaviors, and opportunities to maximize the revenue in their two properties.
2. Suggesting strategies to maximize the revenue in the two properties.
